# Solving-sliding-puzzles-using-path-finding-
Java has been used
This project involves solving a sliding puzzle in video games, where the
player chooses one of four cardinal directions to move until they hit a wall
or a rock. Tasks include setting up a project, implementing a data structure,
adding a parser, and implementing an algorithm to find the shortest path
from the start to the finish. Benchmark examples and examples will be
provided for performance analysis.
