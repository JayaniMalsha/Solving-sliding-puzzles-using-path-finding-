# Solving-sliding-puzzles-using-path-finding-
Java / Breadth-First Search Algorithm

This project focuses on solving sliding puzzles in video games, such as the one given in the example. The player starts at the location "S" and wants to reach the finish "F". They choose one of four cardinal directions to move each turn, but the floor is covered in frictionless ice, so they keep sliding until they hit the wall surrounding the area or one of the rocks (labelled "0").

The course consists of four tasks:

1. Set up a Java project, as you did for the tutorial exercises.
2. Choose and implement a data structure that can represent maps like this one, providing the necessary infrastructure for finding a shortest path from the start to the finish.
3. Add a simple parser that can read a map like the one in the example from an input file, determining the width and height, and the locations of the start and finish squares, as well as the rocks.
4. Choose and implement an algorithm that finds the shortest path from the start to the finish in any given map, if one exists. It should output all the steps of the solution it found.

In summary, this project aim is how to solve sliding puzzles using path finding techniques.
